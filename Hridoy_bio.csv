What projects he did?,"
Image analysis and processing of Xray, NIR and VIS imaging data, present EDA to the team and development of data pipeline using machine and deep learning algorithms. 
Developed ML and AI model to process Xray, RGB image for different detection and segmentation on advanced purity in corn seeds which has an estimation value of $20M.
Developing AI model for Xray imaging of corn infestation, corn embryo detection which has estimation value of $.3M.
Developed end to end data pipeline in AWS to automate image data extraction and modeling which enhancement resulted in a remarkable 2x reduction in data processing time, significantly optimizing overall efficiency.
Analysis and GUI development of hyperspectral, medical image and protein data for different use cases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Developed hyperspectral imaging software and created toolbox including machine learning, labeling toolbox etc. "
,he recently did some generative AI projects which wil be benefical to create any new bots or fine tune model
